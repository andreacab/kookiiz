HEALTH_CARB_TIPS;0;Pasta (75g of glucids per 100g of pasta], fruits, dried vegetables, bread, bananas, rice, and potatoes are the most rich sources of glucids.;1
HEALTH_CARB_TIPS;1;The simple glucids, such as those contained in fruits, are easily assimilated by the organism as fuel. Complex glucids, such as starch contained in pasta, are stored in the liver and in muscles.;1
HEALTH_FAT_TIPS;0;Oils (100% of lipids), dairy products, meat, delicatessen, as well as some species of fish (salmon, tuna...) and some fruit (almonds, nuts, avocado...) are the main sources of lipids.;1
HEALTH_FAT_TIPS;1;Pastries, deep fried ingredients, pizzas, hamburgers, and ready-to-eat meals contain a large amount of lipids. As an example, a croissant contains about 50% of lipids.;1
HEALTH_GRAPH_TIP;0;Your average intake of;1
HEALTH_GRAPH_TIP;1;is smaller than the recommended values.;1
HEALTH_GRAPH_TIP;2;is larger than the recommended values.;1
HEALTH_GRAPH_TIP;3;is as recommended.;1
HEALTH_KCAL_TIPS;0;Calories are mainly supplied by lipids (9 Cal per g), alcohol (7 Cal per g), glucids (4 Cal per g) and proteins (4 Cal per g).;1
HEALTH_KCAL_TIPS;1;Ideally, 55% of acquired calories should be a result of glucidic intake, 30% of lipidic intake, and 15% of proteinic intake.;1
