WARNING: lang.csv MUST BE encoded in UTF-8 (and NOT in ANSI, as Excel does).

All the language data is now gathered in a single file called "lang.csv".
This file contains all the data from "fr.csv", "en.csv" and "de.csv".
These old files have not yet been deleted but they will be soon.
The language importation script has been updated to read "lang.csv" instead of the old files.
This change has been operated to make it easier to translate the text strings with the
original text on the same line.
